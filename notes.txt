# Slide 4 - How does it work

  Work in Pairs
  with TDD
  Work on 1 problem all the time,

Structure:
  6 sessions
  45 minutes each
  delete the code after session
  Retrospective reflect on what happened.
  Each session gets a new twist, a new working style.

Exercise is Game of Life

# Slide 5 - My Experience

My experience:
  - Haven't learned about TDD (because already very experienced)
  - Practised with JavaScript/Mocha
  - Learned 3 tricks for pair programming (change role after each step, mentor-mentee, task list)
  - Tried Tandoori style kata
  - Got to peek at Haskell

# Slide 6 - More Info Available
